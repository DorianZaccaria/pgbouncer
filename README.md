PGBouncer Cookbook
==================

This cookbook provides a [Chef LWRP](http://docs.opscode.com/lwrp.html) that sets up 
a basic [PGBouncer](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgBouncer) connection pool that 
fronts a Postgresql database.  It has example configuration for integration on client machines,
exposing a local *nix socket that routes to a downstream database on another host.

Requirements
============

Chef 0.7+

Platform
--------

* Ubuntu (tested)
* Debian (should work but untested)
* RHEL, Centos, etc (untested)

Cookbooks
---------

It requires the 'apt' cookbook in order to function

Resources/Providers
===================

This exposes a single resource/provider pair, referred as `pgbouncer_connection`.  A basic 
example of it's use can be found in `recipes/example.rb`, but we'll outline it here too.

`pgbouncer_connection`
----------------------

Sets up and starts an Upstart service for pgbouncer, for the database alias you configure it for.

### Actions
- :setup: set up and configure a pgbouncer service for the database alias provided with included parameters (default action)
- :start: start a pgbouncer service for the database alias provided
- :stop: stop a pgbouncer service for the database alias provided
- :teardown: deletes the configuration files associated with the database alias provided

### Examples
    # setup and start a connection pool
    pgbouncer_connection "database_example_com_ro" do
      db_host "database.example.com"
      db_port "6432"
      db_name "test_database"
      userlist "readwrite_user" => "md500000000000000000000000000000000", "readonly_user" => "md500000000000000000000000000000000"
      max_client_conn 100
      default_pool_size 20
      action [:setup, :start]
    end

    # stop a connection pool
    pgbouncer_connection "database_example_com_ro" do
      action :stop
    end

    # TODO: include more examples

Recipes
=======

default
-------

This recipe is empty to hopefully help indicate that this is a resource-only cookbook.

example
-------

This recipe is here to give an example of how to use the resource, as well as the one that
gets exercised in the spec/ tests.

Testing
=======

This cookbook has been "Tested in Production"&trademark;, but also has some basic RSpec tests
that can be executed.

**NOTE**: because Chef has cookbook naming expectations, the root repo expects to be in a folder
named 'pgbouncer'.

     bundle install
     bundle exec rake spec

Additionally, it's been run through Foodcritic to ensure we're at least not egregiously violating
something.

	bundle install
	bundle exec rake foodcritic
